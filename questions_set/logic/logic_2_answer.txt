But this only shows that "filial piety" is gradually expanded from the "love of relatives" in Confucianism, and it does not show that all the practices of "filial piety" in history are voluntary. Especially in the patriarchal society, "filial piety" is not only a personal choice, but also an ethical norm and social system, with a certain degree of compulsion and obligation, not "always consciously voluntary".
